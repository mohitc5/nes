# 6502 CPU — NES Emulator

A cycle-correct emulation of the MOS 6502 (NES variant) in modern C++.
This is the CPU core of an in-progress NES emulator; it currently passes all official opcodes
in [`nestest`](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Emulator_tests#nestest), which is the standard golden-log
test ROM used to validate 6502 implementations and serves as the foundation for the PPU and
bus integration that follow.

> **Status:** CPU core complete and verified against `nestest`. PPU in progress, targeting NROM (Mapper 0) titles.

## About the 6502

The NES's 6502 is an 8-bit CPU running at ~1.79 MHz with a 16-bit address bus, three GP
registers (`A`, `X`, `Y`), a stack pointer, a program counter, and a 7-flag status register.
Every instruction encodes both an *operation* and an *addressing mode* — and for the emulator
to be useful downstream, both have to be **flag-correct and cycle-correct**, because real
games depend on subtle side effects that are easy to get wrong.

What this implementation handles:

- **All 151 official opcodes** across **13 addressing modes** — immediate, zero page,
  zero page,X/Y, absolute, absolute,X/Y, indirect, indexed indirect (`(zp,X)`),
  indirect indexed (`(zp),Y`), relative, accumulator, and implied.
- **Per-instruction cycle counting**, including the +1 page-cross penalty on indexed
  addressing modes and the +1 / +2 penalties on taken branches.
- **All seven status flags** (`N V B D I Z C`) with correct semantics — including the
  `V` (overflow) on `ADC`/`SBC` and the `B`-flag distinction between
  `BRK`/`PHP` pushes and hardware interrupts.
- **Stack and interrupt model** — `BRK`, `RTI`, `JSR`/`RTS`, and the
  NMI / IRQ / RESET vectors at `$FFFA`–`$FFFF`.
- **Documented hardware quirks** — the indirect `JMP` page-boundary bug and the
  NES' lack of working decimal mode (the `D` flag is encoded but ignored
  by the ALU, which `nestest` exercises).

## Verification
The CPU was validated throughout developement using test ROMs created by 100th_Coin from his NES
Emulator guide, passing all CPU related tests.
The CPU is validated against `nestest`, the canonical 6502 test ROM. Run with `PC` initialized
to `$C000` (automated mode), the emulator's trace output is byte-comparable to `nestest.log`
across the official-opcode portion of the ROM:

- ✅ Register state (`A`, `X`, `Y`, `P`, `SP`)
- ✅ Cycle count after every instruction
- ✅ All flag transitions

This is the standard correctness bar for a 6502 implementation, and it covers the full
instruction set that every commercial NROM game depends on.

## Design

The CPU lives in a single self-contained class (`c6502`) exposing a tick-driven step
interface. Addressing-mode logic and opcode logic are decoupled, so each instruction is
written against an effective address rather than duplicated per addressing mode — `LDA`
is one function, not eight. Memory access goes through a bus abstraction so the same CPU
can later be wired to the PPU, APU, RAM, and cartridge mappers without changes to the core.

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohitc5/nes.git
cd nes
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/nes <path-to-rom.nes>
```

Requirements: C++ compiler and CMake ≥ 3.16. Builds clean with `-Wall -Wextra`.

## Repository layout

## Roadmap

- [x] 6502 CPU core — all official opcodes, `nestest` passing
- [ ] PPU — background rendering, sprite evaluation, NMI on VBlank
- [ ] NROM (Mapper 0) cartridge + memory bus
- [ ] SDL2 frontend — framebuffer output, controller input
- [ ] **Goal:** boot a commercial NROM title (e.g. *Donkey Kong*)
